# Factory Method Pattern
## Preamble

The Factory Method Pattern is part of a larger family commonly referred to as "Factory Patterns", which includes:
- simple factory
- factory method
- abstract factory

The "Simple Factory" cannot be considered a real pattern, as it is essentially the intuitive practice of wrapping the creation of an object in a concrete class.

This is what is commonly done with any piece of code you want to isolate to respond to the concepts of "code reuse" and "single responsibility".

In this article we will therefore focus on the "Factory Method Pattern".

## Definition

> "The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
> Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses."
